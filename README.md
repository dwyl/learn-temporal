# Learn Temporal

A quick intro to 
[temporal.io](https://temporal.io) 
for busy engineers who need to get started fast!

## Why?

<!--
You are building a system used by _millions_ of people
and processing _billions_ of transactions each day.
-->

You need the declarative log-based transactional workflow engine 
with built-in task queue, state management and retry mechanism 
to handle communicating/coordinating with several slow 
or unreliable 3rd party systems.

If that sounds like a bit of a buzzword soup, 
don't worry, we will break it down below.


<!--
You need to build a robust system but don't want to use Elixir/Erlang which has all of this either built-in or easily reachable e.g: https://github.com/safwank/ElixirRetry
-->
