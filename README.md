    <strong>Learn Temporal</strong>: a <em><strong>quick intro</strong></em> to 
    <strong><a href="https://temporal.io">temporal.io</a></strong> (<em>Workflow Engine</em>)
    for <em><strong>busy engineers</strong></em>.
  </p>
</div>

## Why?

<!--
You are building a system used by _millions_ of people
and processing _billions_ of transactions each day.
-->

You need the declarative log-based transactional workflow engine 
with built-in task queue, state management and retry mechanism 
to handle communicating/coordinating with several slow 
or unreliable 3rd party systems.

If that sounds like a bit of a buzzword soup ...

don't worry, we will break it down as we go.

You can still play buzzword bingo if you like.
Or just have a sip of water each time 
the CEO/CTO of Temporal says the word "scalable". ðŸ˜‰

<!--
You need to build a robust system but don't want to use Elixir/Erlang 
which has all of this either built-in or easily reachable e.g: https://github.com/safwank/ElixirRetry
-->


## What?

A workflow engine that can simplify writing orchestration between various APIs/services.



## Who?

If you are building a complex app that has many moving parts 
e.g: microservices, datastores & 3rd party / unreliable APIs,
Temporal can greatly simplify this process.

If you're _not_ building something 
that has many moving parts,
you **_probably_**
[**don't need**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) 
Temporal, yet. <br />
You can still _learn_ how Temporal Workflows work 
if you're _curious_;
that's great!
But don't feel the need to over-engineer
a simple App just because you have a shiny new tool.

## How?

If you're feeling adventurous, 
dive straight into the official 
`TypeScript` Hello World Walkthrough:
https://docs.temporal.io/docs/typescript/hello-world/

It's a good way for you
to see how good the Temporal docs 
& onboarding steps are.

If (when) you get stuck,
or if you don't want to waste too much time,
come back here for the step-by-step guide.

### Building Construction Analogy

If we use real-world construction as the basis for an analogy.

<img width="1047" alt="skyscraper vs. house" 
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/158482229-c4de7310-6f60-40a9-90fd-347392126293.png">

If you're building a free-standing single-family home,
traditional framing 
(bricks+mortar, timber & standard job-site tools)
is probably adequate 
to achieve a good result.
Many impressive homes and even palaces have been built with this method over the centuries
and it's still a perfectly valid means of construction today.

This would be your standard 
but perfectly functional web framework
which can be deployed in 5 minutes and scaled to meet the demand/needs of the intended audience.


However if you are building a **sky scraper** or a new **city**,
you need to think about the _infrastructure_ and use a very different 
construction method,
e.g. steel reinforced concrete, 
large quantities of structural glass,
excavators, tower cranes & specialised engineering contractors.

Temporal is a framework for a different level of engineering challenge.
If you're not building the digital equivalent of a Skyscraper,
use something simpler 
that doesn't require a dedicated DevOps person on your team.

The vast majority of architects, engineers and trades people are not building skyscrapers.
But if you are a City Planner or Structural Engineer, 
then by all means use consider the advanced tools for the job.
