    A <em><strong>quick intro</strong></em> to 
    <strong><a href="https://temporal.io">temporal.io</a></strong> (<em>Workflow Engine</em>)
    for <em><strong>busy engineers</strong></em>.

## Why?

<!--
You are building a system used by _millions_ of people
and processing _billions_ of transactions each day.
-->

You need the declarative log-based transactional workflow engine 
with built-in task queue, state management and retry mechanism 
to handle communicating/coordinating with several slow 
or unreliable 3rd party systems.

If that sounds like a bit of a buzzword soup, 
don't worry, we will break it down below.


<!--
You need to build a robust system but don't want to use Elixir/Erlang 
which has all of this either built-in or easily reachable e.g: https://github.com/safwank/ElixirRetry
-->


## What?

A workflow engine that simplifies writing orchestration between various APIs/services.


## Who?

If you are building a complex app that has many moving parts 
e.g: microservices, datastores & 3rd party / unreliable APIs,
Temporal can greatly simplify this process.
